# NameLock-Fix
Hello this name lock fix was made by PotatoIsCool
and was made to ban evade on Rec Room :)

These devs are bitches and they suck at banning people
lmao anyways heres how you do this

First run Name lock fix.exe it should open up once when it 
should tell you if you need to update the script or not 
but once it does that it should close then open up the serial
changer and open DMIEDIT.exe In there go to System info
you should find Serial Number change that to anything you
want and change your UUID if you need more help check
out the video on my youtube www.youtube.com/@PotatoIsCool6089
